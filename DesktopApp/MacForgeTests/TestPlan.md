# MacForge Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for MacForge, following Apple's testing guidelines and best practices from device management repositories like [Apple's device management](https://github.com/apple/device-management) and [NanoMDM](https://github.com/micromdm/nanomdm).

## Testing Philosophy
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all major functionality, edge cases, and error conditions
- **Accessibility First**: Ensure all features are accessible to users with disabilities
- **Performance Focus**: Maintain high performance standards for enterprise use
- **Security Validation**: Verify all security features work correctly
- **User Experience**: Test workflows from end-user perspective

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests (`MacForgeTests`)
**Purpose**: Test individual components in isolation

#### Core Models
- [x] `AppInfo` model initialization and comparison
- [x] `PPPCService` categorization and validation
- [x] `PPPCConfiguration` creation and management
- [x] `Payload` management and validation

#### Business Logic
- [x] `BuilderModel` payload management
- [x] `BuilderModel` PPPC configuration handling
- [x] `BuilderModel` template application
- [x] `ProfileBuilderViewModel` wizard step management
- [x] `ProfileBuilderViewModel` navigation logic

#### Services
- [x] `JAMFAuthenticationService` connection validation
- [x] `JAMFAuthenticationService` error handling
- [x] `ProfileExportService` profile generation

#### Mock Services
- [x] `MockJAMFAuthenticationService` for testing
- [x] `MockProfileExportService` for testing

### 2. Integration Tests
**Purpose**: Test component interactions and workflows

#### Profile Building Workflow
- [ ] Complete profile creation from start to finish
- [ ] PPPC payload configuration workflow
- [ ] Template application and customization
- [ ] Profile export and validation

#### MDM Integration
- [ ] JAMF Pro authentication flow
- [ ] Profile submission to MDM
- [ ] Error handling for network issues
- [ ] Retry mechanisms for failed operations

### 3. UI Tests (`MacForgeUITests`)
**Purpose**: Test user interface functionality and accessibility

#### Landing Page
- [x] All main elements are accessible
- [x] Theme switching functionality
- [x] Navigation to tools

#### Profile Builder
- [x] Navigation and step progression
- [x] Payload selection and management
- [x] Application drop zone functionality
- [x] Template application
- [x] PPPC configuration interface

#### Accessibility
- [x] Proper accessibility labels
- [x] Keyboard navigation
- [x] Screen reader compatibility
- [x] High contrast mode support

#### Performance
- [x] Application launch time
- [x] Profile Builder load time
- [x] Theme switching responsiveness

### 4. Security Tests
**Purpose**: Validate security features and prevent vulnerabilities

#### Authentication
- [ ] OAuth flow security
- [ ] Token storage and management
- [ ] Session timeout handling
- [ ] Credential validation

#### Data Protection
- [ ] Profile data encryption
- [ ] Secure storage of credentials
- [ ] Network communication security
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization

### 5. Performance Tests
**Purpose**: Ensure application meets performance requirements

#### Load Testing
- [ ] Large profile handling
- [ ] Multiple PPPC configurations
- [ ] Template processing speed
- [ ] Memory usage optimization

#### Stress Testing
- [ ] Concurrent operations
- [ ] Large file handling
- [ ] Network timeout scenarios
- [ ] Resource exhaustion handling

## Test Environment

### Prerequisites
- macOS 12+ (Sonoma, Ventura, Monterey)
- Xcode 15+
- Swift 6 compatibility
- Network access for MDM testing

### Test Data
